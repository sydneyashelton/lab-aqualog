# lab-aqualog
This code is for compiling various different indices/measurements from the Aqualog Data:
For absorbance data, it pulls out decadic a254 for SUVA calculation, Spectral Slopes and Slope Ratio, and compiles the spectra
For fluorescence data, it calculates BIX, HIX, FI, P/H, Protein-like, Humic-like and dilution correction based on the old fluorometer methods
For fluorescnece data, it also will perform inner-filter effect correction, raman normalization, raman/rayliegh scatter correction, correction for dilution, and calculte indices using staRdom.
